# Kirill Bitskyi

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here you will find information about my skills and more.

## About me

Software Engineering student. I love coding, was a technical assistant for CRM systems, built funnel algorithms and did troubleshooting. I have experience in 2d and 3d, also was an author of student works on order, mostly coursework. At the moment I am actively developing in the IT sphere, from programming languages I know Python, but more and more I move to Go and leave the first one for scripts. I am in the process of getting Google IT Support Certification, also studying DevOps, trying my hand at layout out of interest.
